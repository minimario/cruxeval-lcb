Inside the while loop, another while loop is entered, which continues until r reaches the length of s or the count of consecutive repeating characters reaches 2.\n46.

The function then updates the answer ans to the maximum of the current answer and the length of the substring from l to r.\n48.

The function dp is defined inside maximumJumps, which is a recursive function that takes an index idx as an argument.\n3. If idx is equal to n - 1 (where n is the length of nums), the function returns 0.\n4. If idx is not equal to n - 1, the function initializes res to -1.\n5. The function then iterates over the range of idx + 1 to n.\n6. If the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[idx] is less than or equal to target and dp(i) is not equal to -1, the function updates res to the maximum of res and 1 plus dp(i).\n7. After the loop, the function returns res.\n8. Finally, the function returns dp(0).\n\nThe function maximumJumps returns the maximum number of jumps that can be made from the first element of nums to the last element of nums, given that the

a set that satisfies certain constraints.\n\nThe function maximumJumps is a problem of dynamic programming, where the solution is a problem that can be solved by breaking it down into smaller subproblems and solving those subproblems first.\n\nThe function maximumJumps is a problem of graph theory, where the solution is a path in a graph that satisfies certain constraints.\n\nThe function

        "Let's execute the code step by step:\n\n1. The function numberOfPoints is defined, which takes a list of lists as an argument.\n2. A list mark is initialized with 200 zeros.\n3. For each list in the input list, the function iterates over the range from the first element of the list (inclusive) to the second element of the list (inclusive).\n4. For each of these numbers, the corresponding index in the mark list is set to 1.\n5. Finally, the function returns the sum of all elements in the mark list.\n6.
